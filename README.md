# inloopo Trading Stats

Traders need to track their progress over time to eventually sit down and assess their progress, reflect decision they made, sharpen their mindsets and iterate on their strategy.

This app aims to be a trader's daily companion and single source of truth for providing insights on their trading activity via data visualizations such as charts and tables.

## Development

Install [modd](https://github.com/cortesi/modd) on your local machine to start the development server with running `modd` in the root directory, which re-compiles the PocketBase server and the Vue SPA on file changes.

```shell
go install github.com/cortesi/modd/cmd/modd@latest
# start dev server
modd
```
